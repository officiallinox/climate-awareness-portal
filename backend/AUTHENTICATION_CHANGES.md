# Authentication System Changes

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Password Hashing
- **Problem**: Passwords were stored in plain text in the database
- **Solution**: 
  - Added bcrypt password hashing in the User model using pre-save middleware
  - Passwords are now automatically hashed with a cost factor of 12 before saving
  - Added `comparePassword` instance method for secure password verification

### 2. Removed "Other" Gender Option
- **Problem**: Registration form had "Other" gender option
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed the "Other" radio button from the registration form
  - Updated User model to only accept 'male' or 'female' values
  - Form now only shows Male and Female options

### 3. Complete MongoDB Integration
- **Problem**: Login and registration weren't properly connected to MongoDB
- **Solution**:
  - Updated User model with all required fields (name, email, password, phone, gender, dob, role)
  - Enhanced registration route to save all user data to MongoDB
  - Improved login route with proper password verification
  - Added comprehensive error handling and validation

## üìÅ Files Modified
